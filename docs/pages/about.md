# Scope & Objectives: 
 
Microbial genome sequencing can be leveraged to address numerous questions about infectious diseases during both routine surveillance and emergency response scenarios. Genomic applications span a wide range of pathogens and include analyses such as outbreak investigations, antimicrobial resistance monitoring, variant surveillance, phylogenetic studies, and risk assessment of mutations of concern. During outbreaks and periods of heightened response, public health practitioners must quickly prioritize which genomic analyses will be most informative to public health leaders while working under time and resource constraints. 
 
To help navigate these challenges, this resource was developed by the PGCOE network’s Response Base working group to provide strategic guidance for genomic epidemiological investigations during outbreak response scenarios. It provides practical approaches to data visualization and interpretation that can inform situational reports and support public health decision-making. This guide is designed for practitioners who may be uncertain about which questions can be addressed with genomics, which analyses to prioritize, or how to effectively visualize and interpret results for non-experts and decision-makers. While framed through an outbreak response lens, the genomic analyses, visualizations, and interpretation framework presented here can serve as a broader genomic epidemiological resource beyond outbreak investigations.
 
# Assumptions & Limitations: 
 
The analyses described here assume you have identified your pathogen of interest and focus on advanced characterizations of a single, known pathogen rather than multiple pathogens simultaneously. For each analysis, we have assigned a degree of difficulty and identified resources, such as subject matter experts within the PGCoE network, to help answer questions. Each jurisdiction or center may need to prioritize certain analyses based on available expertise, time, and data. Importantly, each analysis has limitations and potential biases that should be carefully considered when interpreting results.
