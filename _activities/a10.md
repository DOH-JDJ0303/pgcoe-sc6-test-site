Analysis: Number Public Health-Relevant Mutations Over Time
Pathogen or pathogen types: well-characterized pathogens
Data required: sequence, collection date, lineage (optional)
Sent in by: Lydia Krasilnikova
Subject matter experts: ____
Potential pitfalls: 
Purpose of analysis (why): 
Notes:
-	Where to get information on which mutations are public-health relevant for which pathogens, much more doable for say SARS-CoV-2 than say mumps
-	Include catalogue of where to find phenotypic information
-	Include table of public health relevant mutations
-	Reference must be identified ahead of time
-	Example from https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7342a1.htm
