### Purpose
Use **`snippy-clean_full_aln`** to clean and prepare the full core genome alignment (`core.full.aln`) generated by **`snippy-core`** before running recombination detection tools such as **`Gubbins`** or **`ClonalFrameML`**.  
**`Snippy-clean_full_aln`** removes invalid characters, trims poorly aligned regions, and ensures the alignment is formatted correctly for downstream phylogenetic analysis.

#### Basic Usage
```bash
snippy-clean_full_aln core.full.aln > core.full.clean.aln
```
### Inputs

- core.full.aln — Full core genome alignment file produced by snippy-core, containing all conserved positions across samples.
- Should include all isolates intended for recombination or phylogenetic analysis.

### Outputs

- core.full.clean.aln — Cleaned alignment with invalid characters and gaps removed; ready for use with Gubbins, IQ-TREE, or other tree-building tools.
- stdout — Cleaning progress and summary information (printed to terminal).
