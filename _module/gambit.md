### Purpose
Use **`GAMBIT`** (Genomic Assignment by Multilocus Bacterial Identification Tool) to determine the species identity of bacterial isolates based on whole-genome assemblies. **`GAMBIT`** compares query genomes to a curated reference database using k-mer–based similarity metrics, assigning the most likely species or genus-level classification.

#### Basic Usage
```bash
gambit query sample.fna --db /path/to/gambit_db/ --out sample_gambit_results.tsv
```
### Inputs

- sample.fna — Assembled bacterial genome in FASTA format (typically generated by shovill).
- Assemblies should be high-quality, contamination-free, and derived from clean reads.

- /path/to/gambit_db/ — Reference database of genomes with known taxonomic identities, used for k-mer–based comparison.

### Outputs

- sample_gambit_results.tsv — Tab-delimited table listing the best database matches, percent similarity, and assigned species identity.
